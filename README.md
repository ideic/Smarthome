# Smarthome
Smarthome is a project how to manage electric things in the house.

As a first step I focused on lamps and their switches.

There are many lamps and switches in a house, in some cases multiple switch controls the same light or multiple lights is controlled by the same switch.

This project uses Arduino nano to query switch's state and to control relays.

A simple Windows application helps you to setup, the topology of the house with switches and lamps.

See Documents folder for Details.
